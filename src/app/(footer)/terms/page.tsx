          <p>

            us or our partners and protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. You may use them for your personal

        {/* 8. Subscriptions and Payments */}
        <div>
          <h2>8. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
          <p>
            While many features of EndlessWiz are free, some premium tools (like advanced lessons or ad-free access)
            require a subscription. You’ll see the fees and billing terms when you sign up. By subscribing, you agree to
            pay on time via your chosen payment method.
          </p>
          <p>
            All fees are in USD and include applicable taxes (which you’re responsible for). If something looks off with
            a charge, let us know within 30 days at support@endlesswiz.com, and we’ll look into it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subscriptions renew automatically unless you cancel before the renewal date. No refunds are offered for
            partial periods, but you can cancel anytime in your account settings.
          </p>
        </div>

            You can stop using EndlessWiz anytime by closing your account. We can also suspend or terminate your access
            if you break these Terms or misuse our Services, without prior notice if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            After termination, sections like Intellectual Property, Limitation of Liability, and Governing Law will
            still apply.

        <div>
          <h2>10. Your Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            We care about your privacy. How we collect, use, and protect your data is explained in our Privacy Policy,
            which is part of these Terms. By using EndlessWiz, you agree to our data practices.

          <h2>11. No Guarantees</h2>
          <p>
            We strive to make EndlessWiz awesome, but it’s provided "as is." We don’t promise it’ll be perfect, always
            available, or meet every expectation. Your English improvement depends on your effort, not just our tools.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* 12. Limitation of Liability */}
        <div>
          <h2>12. Our Liability</h2>
          <p>
            We’re not responsible for indirect damages—like lost time or frustration—arising from your use of EndlessWiz.
            Our total liability won’t exceed what you’ve paid us in the last 12 months (or $50 if you haven’t paid
            anything).

            These Terms are governed by California law, no matter where you’re located. Any disputes will be handled in
            California courts, though we hope it never comes to that!
